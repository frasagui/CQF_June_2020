Mary had a little lamb,
It's fleece was white as snow;
And everywhere that Mary went
The lamb was sure to go.

He followed her to school one day
Which was against the rule;
It made the children laugh and play,
To see a lamb at school.

And so the teacher turned him out,
But still he lingered near;
And waited patiently about
Till Mary did appear

"What makes the lamb love Mary so?"
The eager chldren cry;
"Why, Mary loves the lamb, you know,"
The teacher did reply.
